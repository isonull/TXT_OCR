Threshold:
use different method to threshold and group different results;
try to use matrix such as 1,1,1 1,1,1 1,1,1 to deal with noise;   DONE
for a region, try to use distribution to classify blank,non-blank, not word space, and do the threshold;

detection:
for slant image, try to use gaussian distribution and use the varience matrix to form the block;
for bad noise, try to delete small cluster from the image;
use entropy to detect useless region

char recognition:
use context to help determine some vague recognition, context data is fetched from web
first detection use clustering diff min algo to roughly get a training set.

restructure the paper to pdf file:


Dist:
if the set of data is small, try take avr over a region to smooth the data
